# Data Preprocessing

* Importing Dataset
* Separating independent and dependent variables
* Taking care of missing data if any
* Encoding categorical data (from X and Y if needed) and adding dummy variables
* Removing one of the dummy variables to avoid the dummy variable trap
* Splitting independent variables into Training and Test datasets
* Feature Scaling
