# Regression

### Assumptions of a Multiple Linear Regression

* Linearity
    * There must be a linear relationship between the outcome variable and the independent variables.
* Homoscedasticity
    * This assumption states that the variance of error terms are similar across the values of the independent variables.
* Multivariate normality
    * Multiple regression assumes that the residuals are normally distributed.
* Independence of errors
    * Residuals must not be correlated.
* Lack of multicollinearity
    * Multiple regression assumes that the independent variables are not highly correlated with each other.

### Methods of building models

1. All-in
2. Backward Elimination
3. Forward Selection
4. Bidirectional Elimination
5. Score Comparison

Stepwise Regression refers to numbers 2, 3 and 4.
